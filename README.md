# Work with .csv file

I'm trying to:

1. Write a program for a CSV file, loads the data into the appropriate collection. 
The data from this collection can be serialized to a file and then save it. 
In other words, this file stores data and start over.

2. Program function:
a. listing file on the screen
b. Searching some data
c. editing and recording
d. exports to .csv file
